We can create training and validation datasets using the `ImageFolder` class from `torchvision`. In addition to the `ToTensor` transform, we'll also apply some other transforms to the images. There are a few important changes we'll make while creating PyTorch datasets for training and validation:

1. **Use test set for validation**: Instead of setting aside a fraction (e.g. 10%) of the data from the training set for validation, we'll simply use the test set as our validation set. This just gives a little more data to train with. In general, once you have picked the best model architecture & hypeparameters using a fixed validation set, it is a good idea to retrain the same model on the entire dataset just to give it a small final boost in performance.

2. **Channel-wise data normalization**: We will normalize the image tensors by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation across each channel. As a result, the mean of the data across each channel is 0, and standard deviation is 1. Normalizing the data prevents the values from any one channel from disproportionately affecting the losses and gradients while training, simply by having a higher or wider range of values that others.

3. **Randomized data augmentations**: We will apply randomly chosen transformations while loading images from the training dataset. Specifically, we will pad each image by 4 pixels, and then take a random crop of size 32 x 32 pixels, and then flip the image horizontally with a 50% probability. Since the transformation will be applied randomly and dynamically each time a particular image is loaded, the model sees slightly different images in each epoch of training, which allows it generalize better.

## Data Transform

```
# Data transforms (normalization & data augmentation)
stats = ((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010))
train_tfms = tt.Compose([tt.RandomCrop(32, padding=4, padding_mode='reflect'), 
                         tt.RandomHorizontalFlip(), 
                         # tt.RandomRotate
                         # tt.RandomResizedCrop(256, scale=(0.5,0.9), ratio=(1, 1)),

                         tt.ToTensor(), 
                         tt.Normalize(*stats,inplace=True)])
valid_tfms = tt.Compose([tt.ToTensor(), tt.Normalize(*stats)])
# PyTorch datasets
train_ds = ImageFolder(data_dir+'/train', train_tfms)
valid_ds = ImageFolder(data_dir+'/test', valid_tfms)
batch_size = 400
# PyTorch data loaders
train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=3, pin_memory=True)
valid_dl = DataLoader(valid_ds, batch_size*2, num_workers=3, pin_memory=True)
```


## Batch Exploration

```
def denormalize(images, means, stds):
    means = torch.tensor(means).reshape(1, 3, 1, 1)
    stds = torch.tensor(stds).reshape(1, 3, 1, 1)
    return images * stds + means

def show_batch(dl):
    for images, labels in dl:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 12))
        ax.set_xticks([]); ax.set_yticks([])
        denorm_images = denormalize(images, *stats)
        ax.imshow(make_grid(denorm_images[:64], nrow=8).permute(1, 2, 0).clamp(0,1))
        break

```

## Residual Class

```

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=3, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=3, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        
    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.conv1(x)
        out = self.relu1(out)
        out = self.conv2(out)
        return self.relu2(out) + x # ReLU can be applied before or after adding the input
```

## Resnet Class

```

```def conv_block(in_channels, out_channels, pool=False):
    layers = [nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1), 
              nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels), 
              nn.ReLU(inplace=True)]
    if pool: layers.append(nn.MaxPool2d(2))
    return nn.Sequential(*layers)

                                        nn.Flatten(), 
                                        nn.Dropout(0.2),
                                        nn.Linear(512, num_classes))

        out = self.conv2(out)
        out = self.res1(out) + out
        out = self.conv3(out)
        out = self.conv4(out)
        out = self.res2(out) + out
        out = self.classifier(out)
        return out

## Training the model

Before we train the model, we're going to make a bunch of small but important improvements to our `fit` function:

* **Learning rate scheduling**: Instead of using a fixed learning rate, we will use a learning rate scheduler, which will change the learning rate after every batch of training. There are many strategies for varying the learning rate during training, and the one we'll use is called the **"One Cycle Learning Rate Policy"**, which involves starting with a low learning rate, gradually increasing it batch-by-batch to a high learning rate for about 30% of epochs, then gradually decreasing it to a very low value for the remaining epochs. Learn more: https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html

* **Weight decay**: We also use weight decay, which is yet another regularization technique which prevents the weights from becoming too large by adding an additional term to the loss function.Learn more: https://towardsdatascience.com/this-thing-called-weight-decay-a7cd4bcfccab

* **Gradient clipping**: Apart from the layer weights and outputs, it also helpful to limit the values of gradients to a small range to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values. This simple yet effective technique is called gradient clipping. Learn more: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48


Let's define a `fit_one_cycle` function to incorporate these changes. We'll also record the learning rate used for each batch.

## Evaluation

    model.eval()
    outputs = [model.validation_step(batch) for batch in val_loader]
    return model.validation_epoch_end(outputs)

    for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
        return param_group['lr']

    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
    history = []
    
    # Set up cutom optimizer with weight decay
    optimizer = opt_func(model.parameters(), max_lr, weight_decay=weight_decay)
    # Set up one-cycle learning rate scheduler
    sched = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(optimizer, max_lr, epochs=epochs, 
                                                steps_per_epoch=len(train_loader))
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Training Phase 
        model.train()
        train_losses = []
        lrs = []
        for batch in train_loader:
            loss = model.training_step(batch)
            train_losses.append(loss)
            loss.backward()
            
            # Gradient clipping
            if grad_clip: 
                nn.utils.clip_grad_value_(model.parameters(), grad_clip)
            
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Record & update learning rate
            lrs.append(get_lr(optimizer))
            sched.step()
        
        # Validation phase
        result = evaluate(model, val_loader)
        result['train_loss'] = torch.stack(train_losses).mean().item()
        result['lrs'] = lrs
        model.epoch_end(epoch, result)
        history.append(result)
    return history
